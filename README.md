## Fruits and Vegetable Image Classifier

## Introduction
This project implements an image recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately recognize images of fruits and vegetables. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model is trained to distinguish between different types of produce with high accuracy.

## Features
- Recognizes various fruits and vegetables from images.
- Utilizes deep learning techniques for enhanced accuracy.
- User-friendly and easily extensible for new categories.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
## Model Details
The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following specifications:

- **Activation Functions**: ReLU and Softmax
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy

The architecture leverages several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, and ends with fully connected layers for classification
